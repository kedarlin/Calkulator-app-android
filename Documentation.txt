Hello Sir/Mam,
	This Documentation helps you to understand my android studio project for developing a calculator application.
The app's name is "Calkulator", I've implemented the UI design using LinearLayout to arrange the Result text field and buttons.
To differnetiate the numbers, operators and delete buttons, they are been displayed in different colors.
	Each button has its own functions been implemented in the mainActivity.java file, where when each buttons are clicked 
an EventListener listens for clicks and the corresponding functions are done. The entered numbers, operators and results are 
displayed in the Result Layout.
	The application can run on devices above API Level 27.
	Thus the calculator application is developed and run on emulators and phone.
	
						Thank You!!!
